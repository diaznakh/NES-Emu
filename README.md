# NES Emulator

A Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) emulator built with modern C++ and SDL2 for cross-platform compatibility.

## üéÆ Features

- **Complete NES Emulation**: CPU, PPU, and memory management
- **SDL2 Graphics Backend**: Cross-platform graphics rendering
- **iNES Format Support**: Load and play NES ROM files
- **Multiple Mapper Support**: Mappers 000, 001, 002, 003, 004, 066
- **Clean Architecture**: Modular design with separate CPU, PPU, and Cartridge components

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This emulator uses a clean, modular architecture:
- **CPU6502**: 6502 processor emulation
- **PPU2C02**: Picture Processing Unit with OneLoneCoder's rendering approach
- **Cartridge**: ROM loading and mapper support
- **SDL2**: Cross-platform graphics and input handling

## üìã Prerequisites

### Required Libraries

#### macOS
```bash
# Install Homebrew if you haven't already
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install required libraries
brew install sdl2
```

#### Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
```

#### Fedora
```bash
sudo dnf install SDL2-devel
```

#### Windows
- Install [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)

## üöÄ Building

### Build the SDL2 Version
```bash
# Build the emulator
make clean
make

# Run with a ROM file
./nes-emu "path/to/your/game.nes"
```

## üéÆ Controls

### Game Controls
- **Arrow Keys**: Move/rotate pieces
- **X**: A Button (Jump/Rotate)
- **Z**: B Button (Run/Fire)
- **A**: Select
- **S**: Start
- **R**: Reset NES
- **P**: Cycle through palettes
- **Space**: Pause/Resume emulation

## üéØ Supported Games

The emulator supports games using the following mappers:
- **Mapper 000**: Simple games (Tetris, Super Mario Bros)
- **Mapper 001**: MMC1 (Super Mario Bros 3, Metroid)
- **Mapper 002**: UxROM (Castlevania, Contra)
- **Mapper 003**: CNROM (Donkey Kong Classics)
- **Mapper 004**: MMC3 (Super Mario Bros 2, Mega Man)
- **Mapper 066**: GxROM (Super Mario Bros + Duck Hunt)

## üîß Technical Details

### PPU Implementation
The PPU uses OneLoneCoder's exact approach for:
- Background tile fetching and rendering
- Sprite rendering with OAM
- Proper PPU timing (3 CPU cycles per PPU cycle)
- Palette management
- VRAM and nametable handling

### CPU Implementation
- Complete 6502 instruction set
- Proper cycle timing
- Interrupt handling (NMI, IRQ)
- Memory mapping

### Memory Management
- 2KB internal RAM
- 2KB VRAM
- 256-byte OAM
- 32-byte palette RAM
- Cartridge memory mapping

## üêõ Known Issues

### macOS
- **SDL2 Version**: Works perfectly on all macOS versions

### Windows
- Should work correctly with SDL2

### Linux
- Works correctly on Ubuntu, Debian, and Fedora
