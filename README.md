# NES Emulator

A Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) emulator built with modern C++ featuring both SDL2 and OneLoneCoder's PixelGameEngine implementations.

## üéÆ Features

- **Complete NES Emulation**: CPU, PPU, and memory management
- **Dual Graphics Backends**: SDL2 (cross-platform) and OneLoneCoder's PixelGameEngine
- **OneLoneCoder's PPU Implementation**: Accurate background and sprite rendering
- **Advanced Debugging**: Real-time CPU status, palette viewer (OneLoneCoder version)
- **iNES Format Support**: Load and play NES ROM files
- **Multiple Mapper Support**: Mappers 000, 001, 002, 003, 004, 066
- **Clean Architecture**: Modular design with separate CPU, PPU, and Cartridge components

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This emulator uses a clean, modular architecture:
- **CPU6502**: 6502 processor emulation
- **PPU2C02**: Picture Processing Unit with OneLoneCoder's rendering approach
- **Cartridge**: ROM loading and mapper support
- **SDL2**: Cross-platform graphics and input handling
- **OneLoneCoder PixelGameEngine**: Advanced graphics and debugging interface

## üìã Prerequisites

### Required Libraries

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
sudo apt-get install libpng-dev freeglut3-dev  # For OneLoneCoder version
```

#### Fedora
```bash
sudo dnf install SDL2-devel
sudo dnf install libpng-devel freeglut-devel  # For OneLoneCoder version
```

#### Windows
- Install [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)

## üöÄ Building

### SDL2 Version (Recommended for all platforms)
```bash
# Build the SDL2 version
make clean
make

# Run with a ROM file
./nes-emu "path/to/your/game.nes"
```

### OneLoneCoder PixelGameEngine Version (Advanced debugging)
```bash
# Install OneLoneCoder dependencies first
make install-olc-mac      # macOS
make install-olc-ubuntu   # Ubuntu/Debian
make install-olc-fedora   # Fedora

# Build the OneLoneCoder version
make clean
make nes-emu-olc

# Run the OneLoneCoder version
./nes-emu-olc
```

## üéÆ Controls

### Game Controls (Both versions)
- **Arrow Keys**: Move/rotate pieces
- **X**: A Button (Jump/Rotate)
- **Z**: B Button (Run/Fire)
- **A**: Select
- **S**: Start
- **R**: Reset NES
- **P**: Cycle through palettes
- **Space**: Pause/Resume emulation

### Debug Controls (OneLoneCoder version only)
- **C**: Step by step execution
- **F**: Step one frame
- **Space**: Toggle continuous emulation

## üéØ Supported Games

The emulator supports games using the following mappers:
- **Mapper 000**: Simple games (Tetris, Super Mario Bros)
- **Mapper 001**: MMC1 (Super Mario Bros 3, Metroid)
- **Mapper 002**: UxROM (Castlevania, Contra)
- **Mapper 003**: CNROM (Donkey Kong Classics)
- **Mapper 004**: MMC3 (Super Mario Bros 2, Mega Man)
- **Mapper 066**: GxROM (Super Mario Bros + Duck Hunt)

## üîß Technical Details

### PPU Implementation
The PPU uses OneLoneCoder's exact approach for:
- Background tile fetching and rendering
- Sprite rendering with OAM
- Proper PPU timing (3 CPU cycles per PPU cycle)
- Palette management
- VRAM and nametable handling

### CPU Implementation
- Complete 6502 instruction set
- Proper cycle timing
- Interrupt handling (NMI, IRQ)
- Memory mapping

### Memory Management
- 2KB internal RAM
- 2KB VRAM
- 256-byte OAM
- 32-byte palette RAM
- Cartridge memory mapping

## üêõ Known Issues

### macOS
- **SDL2 Version**: Works perfectly on all macOS versions
- **OneLoneCoder Version**: May have GLUT compatibility issues on newer macOS versions

### Windows
- Both versions should work correctly

### Linux
- Both versions should work correctly on Ubuntu, Debian, and Fedora
