# NES Emulator

A Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) emulator built with modern C++ and featuring both SDL2 and OneLoneCoder's PixelGameEngine implementations.

## üéÆ Features

- **Complete NES Emulation**: CPU, PPU, APU, and memory management
- **OneLoneCoder's PPU Implementation**: Accurate background and sprite rendering
- **Multiple Graphics Backends**: SDL2 (cross-platform) and OneLoneCoder's PixelGameEngine
- **Advanced Debugging**: Real-time CPU status, audio visualization, palette viewer
- **iNES Format Support**: Load and play NES ROM files
- **Multiple Mapper Support**: Mappers 000, 001, 002, 003, 004, 066
- **Frame-by-Frame Stepping**: For debugging and development

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This emulator combines the best of both worlds:
- **Our NES Components**: CPU6502, PPU2C02, Cartridge with OneLoneCoder's PPU approach
- **OneLoneCoder's PixelGameEngine**: For advanced graphics and debugging interface
- **SDL2 Backend**: For cross-platform compatibility

## üöÄ Building

### SDL2 Version (Recommended for macOS)
```bash
# Build the SDL2 version
make clean
make

# Run with a ROM file
./nes-emu "path/to/your/game.nes"
```

### OneLoneCoder PixelGameEngine Version
```bash
# Build the OneLoneCoder version
make clean
make nes-emu-olc

# Run the OneLoneCoder version
./nes-emu-olc
```

## üéÆ Controls

### Game Controls
- **Arrow Keys**: Move/rotate pieces
- **X**: A Button (Jump/Rotate)
- **Z**: B Button (Run/Fire)
- **A**: Select
- **S**: Start
- **R**: Reset NES
- **P**: Cycle through palettes
- **Space**: Pause/Resume emulation

### Debug Controls (OneLoneCoder version)

## üéØ Supported Games

The emulator supports games using the following mappers:
- **Mapper 000**: Simple games (Tetris, Super Mario Bros)
- **Mapper 001**: MMC1 (Super Mario Bros 3, Metroid)
- **Mapper 002**: UxROM (Castlevania, Contra)
- **Mapper 003**: CNROM (Donkey Kong Classics)
- **Mapper 004**: MMC3 (Super Mario Bros 2, Mega Man)
- **Mapper 066**: GxROM (Super Mario Bros + Duck Hunt)

## üîß Technical Details

### PPU Implementation
The PPU uses OneLoneCoder's exact approach for:
- Background tile fetching and rendering
- Sprite rendering with OAM
- Proper PPU timing (3 CPU cycles per PPU cycle)
- Palette management
- VRAM and nametable handling

### CPU Implementation
- Complete 6502 instruction set
- Proper cycle timing
- Interrupt handling (NMI, IRQ)
- Memory mapping

### Memory Management
- 2KB internal RAM
- 2KB VRAM
- 256-byte OAM
- 32-byte palette RAM
- Cartridge memory mapping

## üêõ Known Issues

### macOS
- **OneLoneCoder Version**: GLUT window creation may fail on modern macOS due to GLUT compatibility issues
- **SDL2 Version**: Works perfectly on all macOS versions

### Windows
- Both versions should work correctly

### Linux
- Both versions should work correctly
